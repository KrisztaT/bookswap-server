## Installation Guide

Follow the steps outlined below to perform a local installation of both the server and client components on your computer.

### System Requirements

- NodeJS version v19.8.1

### Server Installation

1. Create a directory named `bookswap` and navigate into it:
   ```bash
   $ mkdir bookswap && cd bookswap
   ```
2. Clone the server repository from GitHub or unzip the provided file.
    ```bash
    $ git clone git@github.com:KrisztaT/bookswap-server.git
    or
    $ unzip KrisztinaTesenyi_T3A2-B.zip
   ```
3. Go to the server folder. (In case file was provided use the second line.)
   ```bash
   $ cd bookwap-server
   or
   $ cd KrisztinaTesenyi_T3A2-B.zip/src/bookswap-server
   ```
4. Install the required npm packages:
   ```bash
   $ npm install
   ```
5. Create your `.env` file, if it was not provided, with appropriate DATABASE_URL(s) and JWT_SECRET values.
6. You can seed your local database using the following command:
    ```bash
   $ npm run seed-dev
   ```
7. Launch the server using the following command:
   ```bash
   $ npm run dev
   ```
   You now have access to the API through Postman or by navigating to localhost:3001/ in your web browser. In case a different port is used, please adjust the frontend settings to ensure communication between frontend and backend.

8. To run tests, first make sure that DATABASE_URL_TEST is defined in your `.env` file. Then to seed the test database use the command:
   ```bash
   $ npm run seed-test
   ```
9. After seeding the test database, you can execute tests as well and view the results along with test coverage using:
   ```bash
   $ npm run test-cc
   ```

## Client Installation

1. Open your terminal and navigate to the `bookswap` folder:
   ```bash
   $ cd bookswap
   ```
2. Clone the client repository from GitHub:
   ```bash
   $ git clone git@github.com:KrisztaT/bookswap-client.git
   ```
3. Go to the client folder. (In case file was provided use the second line.)
   ```bash
   $ cd bookswap-client
   or
   $ cd KrisztinaTesenyi_T3A2-B.zip/src/bookswap-client
   ```
4. Install the required npm packages:
   ```bash
   $ npm install
   ```
5. Create your `.env` file, if it was not provided, with appropriate BACKEND
_URL(s).
6. Start the client server with the following command:
   ```bash
   $ npm start
    ```
      The client server will automatically run on http://localhost:3000/ by default, and this URL is configured in the CORS settings. Therefore, if a different port is used, both the backend and frontend components will require modification to ensure the communication between them.

6. To run tests use the command:
   ```bash
   $ npm test
   ```

## Libraries used in the project

### Server Libraries

`bcrypt (^5.1.0)`: Bcrypt is used for hashing passwords and it provides a secure way to hash and compare passwords, making it difficult for attackers to reverse-engineer the original passwords from the hashes.

`cors (^2.8.5)`: CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is a security feature that allows or restricts web resources (such as APIs) to be requested from different domains. The cors library helps in handling CORS headers and settings, making it easier to control and secure the communication between the app's frontend and backend. It's important to note that the application is configured to operate within the local context of "http://localhost:3000" in case of local run. For the application to function correctly from alternative hosts, configuration adjustments are required in the backend.

`dotenv (^16.3.1)`: Dotenv allows the load of environment variables from a .env file into the app's process environment. It is used to keep sensitive configuration details (like database URLs, API keys, etc.) separate from the codebase and safely stored.

`express (^4.18.2)`: Express.js is a framework designed for Node.js that streamlines the development of powerful and scalable web applications and APIs. It offers a comprehensive set of tools for managing routes, handling requests and responses, implementing middleware, and other essential functionalities required for building this application.

`express-validator (^7.0.1)`: The express-validator library is utilised to validate and sanitise incoming request data in applications. It plays a crucial role in mitigating common security vulnerabilities such as cross-site scripting (XSS) and SQL injection by sanitising user inputs. This library was used to validate data from frontend forms related to login, join, book, and listing functionalities.

`helmet (^7.0.0)`: Helmet is a security middleware that enhances the security of an application by configuring various HTTP headers. These headers help guard against prevalent security threats, including Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks, clickjacking, and others.

`jsonwebtoken (^9.0.1)`: The jsonwebtoken library enables the generation and verification of JSON Web Tokens (JWTs), which serve as a secure and efficient method for exchanging claims between two parties. JWTs are commonly used in web applications to implement authentication and authorisation mechanisms.

`mongoose (^7.3.2)`: Mongoose is a library that serves as an Object Data Modeling (ODM) tool for MongoDB and Node.js. It offers a schema-based interface for interacting with MongoDB databases, simplifying the process of defining models, querying data, and executing Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations.

`Jest (^29.6.1)`: Jest is a testing framework for JavaScript applications and offers a set of testing tools, to help ensuring the quality and accuracy of the code.

`Nodemon (^3.0.1)`: Nodemon is a utility tool used in development that watches for modifications in the source code and automatically restarts the server when changes are detected.

`Supertest (^6.3.3)`: Supertest is a library for testing HTTP endpoints, it enables sending HTTP requests to apps's API routes and assert the responses, simplifying the process of writing automated tests for the API endpoints.

`react-bootstrap-icons (^1.10.3)`: This library offers a collection of Bootstrap icons as individual React components. It allows easy integration of icons into React components and UI elements.

`react-dom (^18.2.0)`: React DOM is a package that provides the methods and components necessary for rendering React applications in the browser. It facilitates the interaction between React components and the actual HTML DOM.

`react-router-dom (^6.14.1)`: React Router DOM is a library for adding routing and navigation capabilities to React applications. It allows the creation of multi-page apps by defining routes and managing the rendering of different components based on the URL.

`@testing-library/jest-dom (^5.16.5)`: The Jest DOM library extends the capabilities of Jest for asserting DOM-related expectations in tests.

`@testing-library/react (^13.4.0)`: Testing Library for React is a testing framework that emphasises testing user interactions and behavior rather than implementation details. It provides utilities for simulating user actions and asserting the resulting state and rendered output of React components.

`@testing-library/user-event (^13.5.0)`: This library complements Testing Library by simulating user interactions, such as clicks, typing, and focusing, in a way that closely resembles how a real user interacts with a web application.
